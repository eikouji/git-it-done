# Description #

A module project to learn third party APIs.

# What I was supposed to learn #
- GitHub API End points
- Multiple Parameters in query string
- Dynamically updated an API call using HTML attributes

# What I learned specfically that will help me in the long run #
I thought 1(one) = l (lower case L), so I kept typing repoE1 (one) instead of repoEl (element) for all my variables.
  - By learning this small difference, and catching my tiny mistake, and because 1 looks identical to lowercase l in coding font, I may've just caught myself on several layers of errors I may've made in the past with using one type of variable (labelE1 (one)) and mixing up with a different variable (labelEl (element).

Now that I know that a variable, like repoEl is actually l for L, like in ELEMENT, the rest of my coding and coding projects SHOULD be a little easier to understand and for anyone looking at my code to understand. 

OR, If I'm going to use E1 (one), I have to be consistent and use E1 (one) for all my variables and not mix it up with El (L, for element). 

# This module included #
- Server-side APIs
- use Fetch API to make requests to a server-side API
- used DevTools Network tab to see cool things like if the fetch requests were workin. And they were!
- create dynamic HTTP using JavaScript
- created an input error code when user does not put in a username in the search field!
- got more familiar with DevTools both in Chrome and in Firefox, and knowing where to find the information per each devTools window. Sometimes Firefox was easier for me to read, and sometimes it was easier to follow what Chrome's Dev tools window had to say, or finding what the module wanted me to look at.
